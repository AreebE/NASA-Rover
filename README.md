# NASA-Rover
My description on how I made my NASA rover, what parts I used, and the code I have used
Note: This was all inspired by https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover, where I took most of the instructions from. Unfortunately, I was missing certain parts, so I had to make do and switch out some with others. Furthermore, some specific parts, like clamps and most threaded objects, were too complicated to make with waterjets or would be too fragile when made with 3D printers -- meaning they had to be bought.

This specific repository is for the creation of the rover.
