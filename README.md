# NASA-Rover
My description on how I made my NASA rover, what parts I used, and the code I have used
Note: This was all inspired by https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover, where I took most of the instructions from. Unfortunately, I was missing certain parts, so I had to make do and switch out some with others.

This specific repository is for the creation of the rover. 

For the android code used to operate this rover via phone, check this link:

For the Arduino code used in the rover's brain, check here:
