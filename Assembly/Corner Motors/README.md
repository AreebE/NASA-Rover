# Steps for building the corner motors:

Note that the parts in 'parts.cvs' are only for making one corner wheel.

_Step 1:_

Using 1**A**,1**B**,2**D**,2**K**, and 1**I**, attach the parts as seen in the image below.
* The screws depicted should come with the motor mount.

_Step 3:_

Using 4**K** and 4**G**, attach the current assembly of the motor mount to 1 part **M**. The **M** part should be attached in between of the **K** parts.

---
_Step 5:_

Insert 1 part **M** into the slot between the 2**J** parts. Then use 4**K** and 4**G** parts to bind them togeter.
* Ensure that the newly inserted part **M** is at a right angle to the other part **M**.
